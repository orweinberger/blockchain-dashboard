blockchain-dashboard
====================

This is a small node.js app that retrieves all blocks and transactions via Toshi.io's REST API and pushes the data into Joola, when we're done pushing, we can draw some pretty cool charts using Joola's JS SDK

Pull requests are welcome, there's plenty to tweak, fix and optimize.

**Currently working on the Github page that will render the charts, stay tuned**
